// Everything on the floor coming apart.
//
// There are two kinds of destructible and they are destroyed by opposite means,
// which is the whole reason this module exists:
//
//   * Loose props (chairs, crates) are already their own mesh and their own
//     rigid body. Breaking one is "delete the mesh, re-emit its boxes".
//   * Everything else — desks, shelving, vending machines, window glazing,
//     ceiling tubes — was merged into a batched chunk at generation time and has
//     no mesh of its own to delete. Breaking one means erasing its vertices in
//     place (see `eraseSpan`) and then re-emitting the boxes it was authored
//     from, which the generator captured for exactly this purpose.
//
// Both paths converge on the same debris pool: a capped, timed-out set of loose
// boxes, so a long run can never accumulate rubble until the frame rate dies.
//
// Routing a bullet to the right destructible is the other half of the problem. A
// raycast against a batched chunk hits a mesh shared by a hundred props, so the
// mesh identity tells us nothing. What it does give us is `faceIndex`, and a
// prop's vertices are a contiguous run inside that buffer — so a binary search
// over the runs on that mesh names the prop exactly. No spatial guessing, no
// tolerance to tune, and it stays correct for a pane of glass sitting three
// centimetres in front of a wall.
